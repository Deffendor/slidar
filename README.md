Just in case if we run out of time and still not manage to finish the project on time.

##Project 1 - Code (Completed)
---
Is just Arduino Micro that supports USBMIDI Lib. and tested and it works fine.

![More Details](\Project1_code\Plue_info.PNG "info")

**Check the Video (inside the project 1 code file), Illustrate the output MIDI on the DJ software on PC.**
* Arduino MICRO
* Potentiometer x1
* Button x2

##Project 2 - Code (In Progress)
---
Almost done, the problem is the Uart in Master TM4C MCU send char and strings and bytes to Slave Arduino Micro MCU.
As well the read delay in the difference between them makes it read wrong values sometimes. 
In the photo down below show the final connection, After testing each one alone they work super fine.

Potentiometer can be replace with Slidar Sensor. (Same Output!)

* TM4C123GXL (included LEDS and Buttons in the MCU)
* Arduino Micro
* Potentiometer x1
* Bluetooth Master
* Bluetooth Slave
