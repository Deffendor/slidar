\section{General description}
Design the new revolutionary musical instrument called Slidarr. It senses tiny changes in resistance and translates it to MIDI signals before sending it over USB to a computer running an software synth that produces the audio. The instrument's interface will consist of a metal wire with a constant current running through it. The artist touches the wire at any position with a conductor, that reads a tiny voltage drop depending on its position along the wire. The voltage drop is amplified and fed into an ADC converter on the ARM Cortex, that translates the signal to a corresponding MIDI note.
